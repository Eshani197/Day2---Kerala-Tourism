        <h1 class="mt-4">Palakkad</h1>
        <p class="lh-base">Palakkad, known as the gateway to Kerala, is famous for its lush green landscapes and rich
            cultural heritage. The district is home to the iconic Palakkad Fort, a well-preserved 18th-century fort that
            offers a glimpse into the region's history.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">In addition to its historical attractions, Palakkad is surrounded by scenic hills and
            valleys, making it a great destination for nature lovers and adventure enthusiasts.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">Widely renowned as the Granary of Kerala, Palakkad is situated at the foot of the Western
            Ghats, bordering the neighbouring state of Tamil Nadu. The 40 km gap in the mountains which is known as the
            Palakkad Gap has played a major role in the trade relations between the east and west coasts of peninsular
            India since ancient times. This land was once a massive jungle filled with in numerous Pala trees
            (Alsteriascholaris). The air was constantly imbued with the sweet fragrance of its flowers and hence the
            name Palakkad which literally translates to 'Forests of Pala tree'. A melting pot of the Tamil and Kerala
            cultures this fascinating land is filled with a plethora of experiences for any traveller with a curious
            heart.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">Characterised by its rolling hills, dense forests, never ending expanses of lush green paddy
            fields and serene rivers, Palakkad is a haven for anyone who gets inspired by the quaint beauty of nature. A
            large part of the second longest river in Kerala, the Bharathapuzha flows through Palakkad district. One of
            the most iconic natural landmarks here is the Silent Valley National Park. This UNESCO World Heritage site
            is home to a unique ecosystem teeming with rare flora and fauna. An eerie silence that envelops the
            sanctuary owing to the absence of Cicadas is what gave it the name Silent Valley. Trekking through the dense
            forests of Silent Valley allows visitors to witness the untouched wilderness of Kerala, with opportunities
            to spot elusive wildlife such as the lion-tailed macaque and the Malabar giant squirrel apart from tigers,
            leopards, elephants and snakes.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">The district is also famous for its picturesque dams and reservoirs, which not only serve as
            sources of irrigation but also offer scenic vistas for tourists. The Malampuzha Dam and Gardens are a prime
            example, where lush gardens, amusement parks, and a ropeway complement the expansive reservoir. Visitors can
            enjoy boating in the reservoir or simply relax amidst the tranquil surroundings, making Malampuzha a
            favourite picnic spot for family outings and picnics.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">The numerous forts, temples, and cultural landmarks are a testimony to the rich historical
            legacy the land. The Palakkad Fort, also known as Tipu's Fort, is a major historical attraction in the
            district. Built by Hyder Ali of Mysore in the 18th century, the fort played a pivotal role in the history of
            Kerala. Today, it stands as a testament to the region's tumultuous past and offers panoramic views of the
            surrounding countryside from its ramparts.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">For history enthusiasts, the Jain Temple at Jainimedu is a must-visit. This ancient temple
            complex is adorned with exquisite carvings and sculptures, showcasing the architectural prowess of the Jain
            community that once thrived in Palakkad. The temple provides insight into the cultural and religious
            diversity that has shaped the district over the centuries. </p>

            performing arts flourish. This 'Land of Poorams and Velas' is renowned for its vibrant folk music and dance
            forms, which are integral to local festivals and cultural celebrations. The Kalpathy Ratholsavam, held

            by traditional music and dance performances. The festival not only attracts devotees but also offers
            visitors a glimpse into the essence of Palakkad. The Chinakkathoor Pooram held at the Sree Chinakkathoor
            Bhagavathy Temple is by far one of the most unique and vibrant poor arms in Kerala. Bedecked elephants,
            panchavadyam, pandimelam (traditional orchestra) and vibrant Pulikali performances are the highlights of
            this festival.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">The Nenmara Vallangi Vela is another of the beautiful celebrations held in Palakkad.
            Celebrated annually at the Nellikulangara Bhagavathy Temple, this is a vibrant display of lights, colours,
            fireworks and ritualistic art forms. Kummatti, Andivela and Karivela are some of the unique art forms one
            will get to experience here. The 20th day of the festival bears witness to caparisoned elephants being taken
            for a magnificent procession from both the competing villages of Nenmara and Vallangi to the Nellikulangara
            Bhagavathy Temple. Visitors are enamoured by the festivities as well as the extensive decoration of the
            aanapandhal, the space were the elephants are housed. In every sense this is one festival that should not be
