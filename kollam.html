        <h1 class="mt-4">Kollam</h1>
        <p class="lh-base">Kollam, located on the southwestern coast of India, is a city known for its rich history and
            vibrant culture. Once a major trading port, Kollam is now famous for its cashew industry and beautiful
            backwaters.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">The city is home to several attractions, including the Ashtamudi Lake, which is a UNESCO
            World Heritage Site, and the historic Thangassery Lighthouse. Visitors can also explore the local markets,
            where they can find a variety of handicrafts and spices.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">Kollam, historically known as Quilon, is one of the oldest port cities on the Arabian coast
            and holds a distinct place in Kerala's commercial and cultural history. Once a major center of trade, it
            established trade connections with Phoenicians, Romans, Arabs, and Chinese as early as the 9th century.
            Located along the Ashtamudi Lake and bordered by the Arabian Sea, Kollam's geography is defined by
            waterways, lagoons, and lush coconut groves, making it a picturesque and ecologically vibrant district.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">One of Kollam's greatest natural assets is the Ashtamudi Lake, which opens into a network of
            backwaters and channels. These waters are not only vital for transportation and tourism but also sustain an
            entire ecosystem of fishing communities. Houseboat cruises on Ashtamudi are a major attraction, offering
            visitors a chance to witness life in the scenic villages along its banks. The district also includes coastal
            treasures such as Thangassery Beach, famed for its lighthouse and remnants of colonial rule, and Paravur,
            with its serene estuary and beach convergence.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">Kollam is rightfully called the "Cashew Capital of the World." It is home to hundreds of
            cashew processing units, which provide employment to thousands of people, especially women. The industry is
            a legacy of Portuguese influence and remains a primary economic driver in the region. The city also hosts
            the Cashew Export Promotion Council of India (CEPCI), reinforcing its role in India’s export economy.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">Culturally, Kollam has a deep-rooted heritage. It is associated with renowned poet Kumaran
            Asan, one of the triumvirate poets of modern Malayalam literature. The district's temples, churches, and
            mosques reflect architectural diversity and religious harmony. The Oachira Temple, known for its
            unconventional rituals and the annual Oachira Kali festival, stands out among Kerala’s spiritual landmarks.
            Another significant site is the Sree Mahaganapathi Temple at Kottarakkara, celebrated during the Ganesh
            Chaturthi festivities.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">Kollam is also home to educational institutions and a growing IT presence. The proximity to
            Technopark in Trivandrum and the establishment of satellite hubs within the district have fostered youth
            employment in technology sectors. Health services are also well developed, with institutions like the ESIC
            Medical College and Government Medical College Kollam providing tertiary care.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">The socio-political landscape of Kollam is dynamic. It has historically supported strong
            trade union movements and left-leaning political ideologies. The presence of organized labor in the cashew
            industry and coir sectors has helped in improving labor rights and working conditions. At the same time,
            Kollam's youth are increasingly exploring avenues in entrepreneurship, education, and the creative arts.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">Tourism is further enhanced by attractions like the Jatayu Earth's Center at Chadayamangalam,
            a monumental sculpture and adventure park dedicated to the mythical bird Jatayu from the Ramayana. This
            integrated tourism center combines mythology, art, and eco-tourism, providing cultural insight and adventure
            activities like rock climbing and zip-lining. The Thenmala Ecotourism Project, India's first planned
            ecotourism destination, is another key attraction. With its hanging bridge, forest trails, musical fountain,
            and treetop huts, it appeals to both nature lovers and families.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">Agriculture remains a backbone in many parts of Kollam. Major crops include coconut, banana,
            tapioca, and rice. The district also has a robust inland fishing economy supported by its lakes and rivers.
            The Kallada River, which flows through the district, is an important water source and has hydropower
            projects contributing to the state’s energy grid.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">Transportation in Kollam is well-connected, with a major railway station, port, and access to
            National Highways. The district's inland water transport is also gaining attention as a sustainable
            alternative, and it serves as a key node in the West Coast Canal Project aimed at boosting cargo and
            passenger transport through water routes.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">Environmental conservation is increasingly a concern, particularly with the pressures of
            urbanization, tourism, and industrial development. Local government and environmental groups have launched
            initiatives for lake conservation, solid waste management, and mangrove restoration. Kollam’s wetlands,
            vital for biodiversity and flood control, are being mapped and protected through participatory planning.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">In essence, Kollam is a district where the past and present flow side by side like its own
            backwaters. With its rich trade legacy, thriving industry, vibrant culture, and focus on sustainable
            development, Kollam continues to evolve while maintaining its roots in Kerala’s maritime and spiritual
            traditions. Whether you walk through its historical bazaars, cruise through its lakes, or witness a
            traditional Theyyam performance in a village temple, Kollam offers an experience that is at once grounded
            and transformative.</p>
