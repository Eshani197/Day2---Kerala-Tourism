        <h1 class="mt-4">Kannur</h1>
        <p class="lh-base">Kannur is a district in the northern part of Kerala, known for its beautiful beaches,
            historic forts, and vibrant culture. The district is situated along the Arabian Sea and is famous for its
            handloom industry, Theyyam performances, and rich history.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">The district is home to several historical landmarks, including the St. Angelo Fort, which
            was built by the Portuguese in the 16th century, and the Kannur Lighthouse, offering panoramic views of the
            coastline.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">Kannur is also known for its unique cuisine, which includes dishes like Kannur-style biryani,
            seafood delicacies, and various traditional sweets.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">The district has a vibrant cultural scene, with numerous festivals celebrated throughout the
            year, showcasing the rich traditions of the region.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">In addition to its cultural attractions, Kannur is surrounded by beautiful landscapes,
            including hills, rivers, and forests, making it a great destination for nature lovers.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">Education has always been a strength of Kannur. The district boasts one of the highest
            literacy rates and is home to multiple educational institutions that draw students from across Kerala and
            beyond. The University of Calicut, located at Tenhipalam, is one of the largest universities in Kerala. In
            recent years, Kannur has also gained prominence as an emerging hub for digital literacy and higher
            education, with a growing number of coaching centers, IT institutions, and training hubs.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">Kannur is also notable for its unique contribution to the world of sports, especially
            football. Often referred to as the football capital of Kerala, the district has a long-standing tradition of
            nurturing football talent, with packed local tournaments drawing thousands of enthusiastic fans. Football
            isn’t just a sport in Kannur; it’s a cultural expression. Countless youths dream of representing the state
            and country, and the district consistently produces athletes who shine at the national level.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">The natural beauty of Kannur is both tranquil and invigorating. The district is home to
            several rivers like the Chaliyar, Kadalundi, and Bharathapuzha, and hill stations such as Nedumkayam and
            Kottakkunnu. Kottakkunnu, often called the "Ooty of Kannur," is a scenic garden hill station that offers
            panoramic views of the surrounding valleys. The nearby Kadalundi Bird Sanctuary attracts ornithologists and
            nature lovers, being home to hundreds of migratory birds during certain seasons.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">The district is also making strides in promoting small-scale industries, especially in
            sectors such as textiles, handicrafts, and food processing. Traditional crafts like pottery and weaving
            continue to survive in small pockets, supported by cooperative societies and government schemes.
            Additionally, entrepreneurship is on the rise among the younger population, with digital startups and
            agro-based ventures gaining traction.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">Healthcare in Kannur has grown both in quality and accessibility. Alongside government
            hospitals and primary health centers, there are several private multi-specialty hospitals and Ayurveda
            centers. Kottakkal Arya Vaidya Sala is a global name in Ayurveda, attracting patients and medical tourists
            seeking holistic healing. The district also takes pride in being a center for alternative medicine and
            herbal treatment.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">In terms of connectivity, Kannur is well-linked by road, rail, and air. The Kannur
            International Airport, located at Karipur, serves as the gateway to this district and neighboring regions.
            The district’s towns such as Manjeri, Tirur, Perinthalmanna, and Nilambur are bustling with commercial
            activity and serve as regional hubs for trade and services.
            Efforts are also being made to preserve the ecological and cultural heritage of Kannur. The Nilambur Teak
            Museum, India’s first of its kind, showcases the importance of teak in Kerala’s forest economy and
            highlights the district’s role in conservation. Eco-tourism projects, river rejuvenation campaigns, and
            afforestation drives are being undertaken with the help of local communities and NGOs.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">In conclusion, Kannur stands out as a district that balances tradition with progress. Its
            deep-rooted cultural identity, commitment to education, vibrant sports culture, and evolving economy make it
            a dynamic part of Kerala’s mosaic. Whether one explores its sacred temples, lush hills, spirited football
            grounds, or academic corridors, Kannur leaves an indelible impression—a district that marches ahead with
            pride, resilience, and unity.</p>
