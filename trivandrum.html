        <h1 class="mt-4">Trivandrum</h1>
        <p class="lh-base">Trivandrum, the capital city of Kerala, is known for its rich cultural heritage and
            historical significance. The city is home to several iconic landmarks, including the Padmanabhaswamy Temple,
            which is a major pilgrimage site.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">In addition to its cultural attractions, Trivandrum boasts beautiful beaches, such as Kovalam
            and Vellayani, where visitors can relax and enjoy the scenic views.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">Thiruvananthapuram, the capital district of Kerala, is a land where antiquity and modernity
            blend seamlessly. It is located at the southernmost tip of the state, bordered by the Arabian Sea to the
            west and the Western Ghats to the east.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">With its undulating terrain of low coastal hills and busy commercial areas,
            Thiruvananthapuram stands as a symbol of Kerala’s socio-political, cultural, and technological evolution.
            This district serves not just as the administrative capital of the state but also as a center for art,
            education, science, politics, and tourism.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">The name ‘Thiruvananthapuram’ translates to the “City of Lord Anantha,” referring to the
            deity of the iconic Sree Padmanabhaswamy Temple. This ancient temple, with its intricate Dravidian
            architecture and spiritual importance, is one of the richest temples in the world and the spiritual soul of
            the district. The presence of the temple symbolizes the deep-rooted cultural and religious heritage of the
            region, attracting devotees and tourists alike from across the globe. Its golden tower (gopuram) and secret
            vaults have been subjects of fascination and reverence.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">Thiruvananthapuram is home to several institutions of national and international repute. The
            Vikram Sarabhai Space Centre (VSSC), a key center of the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), is based
            here. The Indian Institute of Space Science and Technology (IIST), Technopark (India’s first and one of the
            largest IT parks), and premier medical and educational institutions like the Sree Chitra Tirunal Institute
            for Medical Sciences and Technology (SCTIMST) and Kerala University make it a hub of learning and
            innovation. This diverse institutional framework has positioned the district as a knowledge capital, drawing
            talent and investment from all over the country.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">The district is also a cultural hotspot. It has been the birthplace and nurturer of some of
            Kerala’s most distinguished poets, writers, and artists. The Kerala State Chalachitra Academy, Kerala
            Sangeetha Nataka Akademi regional center, and the many theatres and art galleries encourage the flourishing
            of traditional and contemporary arts. The annual International Film Festival of Kerala (IFFK), held here, is
            one of the most prestigious film events in Asia, celebrating global cinema and promoting artistic exchange.
        </p>
        <p class="lh-base">In terms of tourism, Thiruvananthapuram is a gateway to several iconic destinations. The
            palm-fringed beaches of Kovalam, known for its lighthouse and Ayurvedic wellness resorts, attract thousands
            of domestic and international tourists. Varkala, another coastal gem in the district, is famous for its
            dramatic cliffs, mineral springs, and a beach that offers both spiritual and recreational experiences. The
            backwaters at Poovar, the serene hill station of Ponmudi, and the wildlife sanctuary at Neyyar enhance the
            district’s allure for nature lovers and adventure seekers.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">Economically, the district is multi-faceted. Apart from being a center of governance and
            information technology, Thiruvananthapuram has a strong base in tourism, healthcare, education, and even
            traditional sectors like coir and handloom. The Vizhinjam International Seaport project is expected to
            transform the logistics landscape of Kerala by making the district a major transshipment hub. In rural parts
            of the district, agriculture still plays a significant role, with crops like coconut, paddy, banana, and
            tapioca being cultivated extensively.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">The district’s demographic diversity is equally striking. It houses people from various
            religious and ethnic backgrounds, living harmoniously in a city that celebrates pluralism. Whether it’s the
            Christian population in coastal areas, the Hindu majority in the city and rural hinterlands, or the Muslim
            communities with deep roots in trade and agriculture, Thiruvananthapuram is an embodiment of Kerala’s
            secular spirit. Festivals such as Onam, Vishu, Christmas, Eid, and Attukal Pongala—the world’s largest
            gathering of women for a religious ritual—reflect the district’s vibrant community life.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">Environmental consciousness has also been a hallmark of Thiruvananthapuram. With the Western
            Ghats to its east, the district includes ecologically sensitive areas that serve as crucial biodiversity
            reserves. Institutions and NGOs work towards the conservation of its hill ecosystems, rivers, and
            coastlines. Urban planning efforts are also incorporating green concepts, though challenges such as traffic
            congestion, waste management, and unplanned development persist and are actively being addressed by local
            bodies.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">Politically, the district holds significance due to the presence of the Secretariat and the
            official residences of the Chief Minister and Governor. It often becomes the nerve center of political
            debates, agitations, and decision-making. The political awareness among its citizens is high, and the
            electorate plays a key role in shaping Kerala’s democratic discourse. Civil society engagement is robust,
            with active participation in policy discussions and local governance.</p>
        <p class="lh-base">In conclusion, Thiruvananthapuram is more than just a capital district. It is the heart of
            Kerala's identity — where ancient temples coexist with cutting-edge science parks, where coastal villages
            live alongside smart city projects, and where culture breathes through every street, festival, and
            conversation. As Kerala continues to grow and evolve, Thiruvananthapuram remains both its anchor and its
            beacon, guiding the state's aspirations with wisdom, creativity, and resilience.</p>
